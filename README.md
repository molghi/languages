# Vanilla JS: LangTutor

About this app:

LangTutor is an aide in language learning that allows users to add, practise, and quiz themselves on custom words and phrases, all stored locally (for now). Inspired by Anki.

App Functionality:

-   Allows one to add individual words through a structured interface.
-   Allows one to bulk-add multiple words through the structured interface.
-   Allows one to import words from a JSON file.
-   Allows one to export words as a JSON file.
-   Allows one to practise and review previously added words.
-   Conducts practice sessions as quizzes with up to 10 questions.
-   Implements an SRS (Spaced Repetition System).
-   Requires users to self-assess their knowledge after each session by selecting Wrong, Hard, Good, or Easyâ€”essential for the SRS to function correctly.
-   Shows a greeting or advice screen.
-   Shows small, custom-made pop-ups with language-related details.
-   Displays the last practice time and count of completed sessions.
-   Allows one to customise the interface accent colour.
-   Online functionality: Generates practice sessions from a large word dataset (over 7,000 words). However, please note that due to the peculiarities of machine translation, session content can sometimes be bizarre and barely relevant to the displayed word or accidental comedic gold. If that's the case, I hope it made you smile (and remember that word).
